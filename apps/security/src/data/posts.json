    "content": "Zero Trust is a security framework that requires all users, whether inside or outside the organization's network, to be authenticated, authorized, and continuously validated before being granted access to applications and data.\n\n## Core Principles\n\n### 1. Verify Explicitly\nAlways authenticate and authorize based on all available data points, including user identity, location, device health, service or workload, data classification, and anomalies.\n\n### 2. Use Least Privilege Access\nLimit user access with just-in-time and just-enough-access (JIT/JEA), risk-based adaptive policies, and data protection to protect both data and productivity.\n\n### 3. Assume Breach\nMinimize blast radius and segment access. Verify end-to-end encryption and use analytics to get visibility, drive threat detection, and improve defenses.\n\n## Implementation Steps\n\n1. Define your protect surface\n2. Map transaction flows\n3. Build a Zero Trust architecture\n4. Create Zero Trust policy\n5. Monitor and maintain",

Scanning\n- Port scanning and service enumeration\n- Vulnerability scanning\n- Web application analysis\n\n### 3. Gaining Access\n- Exploit vulnerabilities\n- Credential attacks\n- Social engineering\n\n### 4. Maintaining Access\n- Persistence mechanisms\n- Privilege escalation\n- Lateral movement\n\n### 5. Analysis and Reporting\n- Document findings\n- Risk assessment\n- Remediation recommendations",
